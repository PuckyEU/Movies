[**MyFavMovies**](https://puckyeu.github.io/MyFavMovies/) is an website, which is made for you to **Discover** what movies or tv shows you would want to watch.

## Todo list

## How will we decide what movies are relevant to you?
- We will take all tags on the current movies (for example "based on novel or book" or "based on comic") and the genres of the movie, after that we will put it in a list how many times you've liked that sepcific genre a tag and what rating you gave it.
